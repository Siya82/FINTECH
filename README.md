# FINTECH
FinTech Data Engineering Architecture
# Financial Market & Economic Intelligence Data Warehouse  

##  Overview  
This project is a **FinTech Data Engineering pipeline** that integrates **three types of data**:  

1. **Stock Market Data** (from Nasdaq Data Link API)  
2. **Macroeconomic Indicators** (from World Bank / FRED APIs)  
3. **Financial News Sentiment** (from NewsAPI / Reddit/Twitter feeds)  

The goal is to create a **streaming + batch-enabled Data Warehouse** that tracks how **macroeconomic trends and financial news sentiment impact stock performance**.  

This simulates what hedge funds, investment banks, and fintech startups build in production — combining **structured (numeric)** and **unstructured (text)** data into a single analytics platform.

##  Data Warehouse Schema  

###  Dimension Tables  

- **`dim_date`**  
  - `date_id` → surrogate key (YYYYMMDD)  
  - `full_date`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `weekday`  
  - Used to join all fact tables on time-based trends.  

- **`dim_company`**  
  - `company_id` → surrogate key  
  - `ticker` (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)  
  - `company_name`, `sector`, `industry`  
  -  Describes each traded company/stock.  

- **`dim_indicator`**  
  - `indicator_id` → surrogate key  
  - `indicator_name` (e.g., CPI, GDP, Interest Rate)  
  - `source` (e.g., FRED, World Bank)  
  -  Normalizes macroeconomic indicators.  

- **`dim_source`**  
  - `source_id` → surrogate key  
  - `platform_name` (Reddit, NewsAPI, Twitter)  
  - `source_url`  
  -  Describes where sentiment/news originates.

###  Fact Tables  

- **`fact_stock_prices`**  
  - `date_id` (FK) → links to `dim_date`  
  - `company_id` (FK) → links to `dim_company`  
  - `open_price`, `high_price`, `low_price`, `close_price`  
  - `volume` → shares traded  
  - `daily_return` → `(close - open)/open`  
  - `rolling_volatility` → stddev of returns over 30 days  
  -  Stores market performance metrics for each stock daily.  

- **`fact_macro_indicators`**  
  - `date_id` (FK) → links to `dim_date`  
  - `indicator_id` (FK) → links to `dim_indicator`  
  - `indicator_value` (e.g., CPI % YoY, GDP growth %)  
  -  Tracks macroeconomic signals by date.  

- **`fact_news_sentiment`**  
  - `date_id` (FK) → links to `dim_date`  
  - `company_id` (FK, optional) → links to `dim_company` if news mentions a stock  
  - `source_id` (FK) → links to `dim_source`  
  - `sentiment_score` → numeric (-1 negative to +1 positive)  
  - `sentiment_label` → categorical (Positive/Neutral/Negative)  
  - `mention_count` → number of articles/posts  
  -  Captures financial news sentiment and its intensity per day.

##  Why These Fields?  

- **OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)** → Core market structure, used for technical indicators (returns, volatility).  
- **Daily Return & Volatility** → Show stock risk/reward patterns.  
- **Macroeconomic Indicators** → Provide context (inflation, GDP, interest rates) that drive stock/sector behavior.  
- **Sentiment Scores & Mentions** → Quantify market psychology.  
- **Dimensions (Date, Company, Source)** → Enable slicing across time, companies, and news platforms.  

---

##  Dashboards  

### 1. **Market Overview**  
- Stock price trends, sector comparisons  
- Heatmap of volatility  

### 2. **Macro vs Market**  
- Inflation vs S&P500 returns  
- Interest rates vs Banking sector performance  
- GDP growth vs Manufacturing stocks  

### 3. **News Impact Analysis**  
- Sentiment vs stock returns (lag correlation)  
- Top 10 companies by positive/negative coverage  
- Word cloud of most-mentioned financial terms
